# UbuntuConnect-AI-Chatbot
# 🌍 UbuntuConnect – AI Chatbot

## 🧠 Introduction
**UbuntuConnect** is a multilingual, no-code chatbot designed to make artificial intelligence (AI) easy to understand and use.  
Inspired by the Ubuntu philosophy — *“I am because we are”* — the project emphasizes inclusivity, cultural relevance, and community empowerment.  
This project was collaboratively developed by a dedicated student team passionate about making AI accessible to all.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Access to AI knowledge is often limited by **cost**, **technical complexity**, and **lack of inclusivity**.  
Most chatbot solutions do not support African languages or non-technical users, leaving many students, professionals, and communities excluded from the digital revolution.

**UbuntuConnect** bridges this gap by offering a **simple**, **multilingual**, and **affordable** AI chatbot that makes learning and engaging with AI accessible to everyone.

---

## 🧩 Tool Choice
The chatbot is built on **[Chatling.ai](https://www.chatling.ai)** — a **no-code platform** chosen for:
- Simplicity and ease of setup  
- Ability to learn from a **custom knowledge base**  
- **Multilingual support**  
- Compatibility with multiple channels (websites, WhatsApp, etc.)

### 🧪 Tools Evaluated
| Tool | Reason for Rejection |
|------|----------------------|
| **Dialogflow** | Relies on predefined questions and answers; lacks generative AI flexibility |
| **Partyrock.aws** | Fully AI-generated but lacks knowledge base support |
| **Landbot** | Complex variable handling and fewer flow customization options |
| **Zapier** | Limited conversation design and no variable capturing |
| **Microsoft Bot Framework** | Requires paid plan; no free usage tier |
